➡️  Next steps
- 👆 Review the logs above and look for any warnings (⚠️ ) that might need follow-up.
- 💡 You may want to run npx @react-native-community/cli doctor to help install any tools that your app may need to run your native projects.
- 🔑 Download your Android keystore (if you're not sure if you need to, just run the command and see): expo fetch:android:keystore

☑️  When you are ready to run your project
To compile and run your project, execute one of the following commands:
- yarn ios
- yarn android
- yarn web

```

For react-native-dotenv, update babel.config.js not .babelrc

Android studio seems to be complainy... yarn android works 100%. It's probably because I dont know which android studio warnings to ignore.

For android
-----
Before releasing, build with `targetSdkVersion = 28`.
For some reason, my emulator doesn't work with that and needs 27

run this:
```
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

We get an output in `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/`
