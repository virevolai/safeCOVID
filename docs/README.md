Let's stop COVID19 together
-------


COVID is the defining challenge of our lifetimes. 

One that central authorities failed miserably at. We can hope that they will do the right thing, eventually. But hope is not a strategy.

We need to reopen the society, but not lose our rights in the process. Once freedom is lost, it won't just be handed back.

Sadly the narrative is that we need to cede more control to governments and corporations... the same ones who are still not adopting the scientific consensus on masks and tests. We do not need more top-down approaches, more surveillance. And even with privacy preserving approaches marketed by Google and Apple, we do not have a way to get mass adoption.

And without mass adoption, those approaches are useless. I'm sure you can see what will happen next in name of health and safety.

"If you are willing to lose rights, you never deserved them to begin with" 

There is another way.

Instead of top-down, the better way to build an antifragile society is bottoms-up, a.k.a Talebian Localism.

We need to hold each other accountable and grow this from the ground up.

How does it work?
----------

You are a responsible person and trust yourself. You trust your family to do the right thing as well... what about your neighbours? The person at the checkout counter?

safeCOVID teaches you a new set of skills, these are - creating a mask cheaply, wearing it properly, and washing hands.

Once you have gone through those and shared with those living with you, you are safeCOVID level 1 in the app.

When you meet someone, 



Apple and Google have proposed a privacy preserving way to track every human interaction and coordinate with the local health authorities on tests.
